# rank

Rank provides a customizable alternative to the built-in
[`rank()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/rank.html) function. The package
offers the following features:

1.  **Frequency-based ranking of categorical variables**: choose whether
    to rank based on alphabetic order or element frequency.

2.  **Control over sorting order**: Use `desc=TRUE` to rank based on
    descending or ascending order.

## Installation

To install **rank** from CRAN run:

``` r
install.packages("rank")
```

You can install the development version of rank like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("selkamand/rank")
```

## Usage

### Categorical Input

``` r
library(rank)

fruits <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange")

# rank alphabetically
smartrank(fruits)
#> [1] 1.5 3.5 1.5 5.0 3.5

# rank based on frequency
smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency")
#> [1] 2.5 4.5 2.5 1.0 4.5

# rank based on descending order of frequency
smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency", desc = TRUE)
#> [1] 3.5 1.5 3.5 5.0 1.5
```

### Numeric Input

``` r
# rank numerically
smartrank(c(1, 3, 2))
#> [1] 1 3 2

# rank numerically based on descending order
smartrank(c(1, 3, 2), desc = TRUE)
#> [1] 3 1 2
```

### Sorting By Rank

We can use `order` to sort vectors based on their ranks. For example, we
can sort the `fruits` vector based on the frequency of each element.

``` r
fruits <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange")
ranks <- smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency")
fruits[order(ranks)]
#> [1] "Pear"   "Apple"  "Apple"  "Orange" "Orange"
```

### Ranking and reordering by priority values

[`rank_by_priority()`](https://selkamand.github.io/rank/reference/rank_by_priority.md)
assigns the *highest* ranks to specified values (in order), while all
remaining values share the same lower rank.  
[`reorder_by_priority()`](https://selkamand.github.io/rank/reference/reorder_by_priority.md)
uses those ranks to move priority values to the front of the vector.

``` r
# Prioritise D first, then C; A and B follow in original order
rank_by_priority(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), priority_values = c("D", "C"))
#> [1] 3.5 3.5 2.0 1.0

# Reorder so priorities come first
reorder_by_priority(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), priority_values = c("D", "C"))
#> [1] "D" "C" "A" "B"
```

### Stratified / hierarchical ranking

[`rank_stratified()`](https://selkamand.github.io/rank/reference/rank_stratified.md)
computes a single combined rank across all columns of a data frame,
where each column is ranked within groups defined by all previous
columns. This produces a true hierarchical ordering.

``` r
data <- data.frame(
  gender = c("male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female"),
  pet    = c("cat", "cat", "magpie", "magpie", "giraffe", "cat", "giraffe", "cat")
)

# Hierarchical ranking:
# 1. Rank gender (globally, by frequency)
# 2. Within each gender, rank pet by within-gender frequency
r <- rank_stratified(
  data,
  sort_by = c("frequency", "frequency"),
  desc    = TRUE
)

data[order(r), ]
#>   gender     pet
#> 3   male  magpie
#> 4   male  magpie
#> 1   male     cat
#> 2   male     cat
#> 7   male giraffe
#> 6 female     cat
#> 8 female     cat
#> 5 female giraffe
```

`smartrank` can be used to arrange data.frames based on one or more
columns, while maintaining complete control over how each column
contributes to the final row order.

#### BaseR

For example, we can sort the following dataframe based on frequency of
fruits, but break any ties based on the alphabetical order of the
picker.

``` r
data <- data.frame(
  fruits = c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange"),
  picker = c("Elizabeth", "Damian", "Bob", "Cameron", "Alice")
)

# Rank_stratified():
# 1. Rank fruits by frequency (globally)
# 2. Within each fruit, rank pickers alphabetically
strat_ranks <- rank_stratified(
  data,
  cols = c("fruits", "picker"),
  sort_by = c("frequency", "alphabetical"),
  desc = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)

data[order(strat_ranks), ]
#>   fruits    picker
#> 5 Orange     Alice
#> 2 Orange    Damian
#> 3  Apple       Bob
#> 1  Apple Elizabeth
#> 4   Pear   Cameron
```

#### Tidyverse Integration

An equivalent way to hierarchically sort data.frames is to use the
tidyverse
[`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html)
function

``` r
library(dplyr)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

arrange(
  data,
  rank_stratified(
    data,
    cols = c("fruits", "picker"),
    sort_by = c("frequency", "alphabetical"),
    desc = c(TRUE, FALSE)
  )
)
#>   fruits    picker
#> 1 Orange     Alice
#> 2 Orange    Damian
#> 3  Apple       Bob
#> 4  Apple Elizabeth
#> 5   Pear   Cameron
```
