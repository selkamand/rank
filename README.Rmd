Rank provides a customizable alternative to the built-in `rank()` function. The package offers the following features:

  1. **Frequency-based ranking of categorical variables**: choose whether to rank based on alphabetic order or element frequency.
  
  2. **Control over sorting order**: Use `desc=TRUE` to rank based on descending or ascending order.

## Installation


To install **rank** from CRAN run:

```r
install.packages("rank")
```

You can install the development version of rank like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("selkamand/rank")
```

## Usage

### Categorical Input

```{r example}
library(rank)

fruits <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange")

# rank alphabetically
smartrank(fruits)

# rank based on frequency
smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency")

# rank based on descending order of frequency
smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency", desc = TRUE)
```


### Numeric Input

```{r}
# rank numerically
smartrank(c(1, 3, 2))

# rank numerically based on descending order
smartrank(c(1, 3, 2), desc = TRUE)
```

### Sorting By Rank

We can use `order` to sort vectors based on their ranks. For example, we can sort the `fruits` vector based on the frequency of each element.

```{r}
fruits <- c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange")
ranks <- smartrank(fruits, sort_by = "frequency")
fruits[order(ranks)]
```

### Ranking and reordering by priority values

`rank_by_priority()` assigns the *highest* ranks to specified values (in order), 
while all remaining values share the same lower rank.  
`reorder_by_priority()` uses those ranks to move priority values to the front of the vector.

```{r}
# Prioritise D first, then C; A and B follow in original order
rank_by_priority(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), priority_values = c("D", "C"))

# Reorder so priorities come first
reorder_by_priority(c("A", "B", "C", "D"), priority_values = c("D", "C"))
```

### Stratified / hierarchical ranking

`rank_stratified()` computes a single combined rank across all columns of a data frame, where each column is ranked within groups defined by all previous columns. This produces a true hierarchical ordering.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  gender = c("male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male", "female"),
  pet    = c("cat", "cat", "magpie", "magpie", "giraffe", "cat", "giraffe", "cat")
)

# Hierarchical ranking:
# 1. Rank gender (globally, by frequency)
# 2. Within each gender, rank pet by within-gender frequency
r <- rank_stratified(
  data,
  sort_by = c("frequency", "frequency"),
  desc    = TRUE
)

data[order(r), ]
```


`smartrank` can be used to arrange data.frames based on one or more columns, while maintaining complete control over how each column contributes to the final row order.

#### BaseR

For example, we can sort the following dataframe based on frequency of fruits, but break any ties based on the alphabetical order of the picker.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  fruits = c("Apple", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear", "Orange"),
  picker = c("Elizabeth", "Damian", "Bob", "Cameron", "Alice")
)

# Rank_stratified():
# 1. Rank fruits by frequency (globally)
# 2. Within each fruit, rank pickers alphabetically
strat_ranks <- rank_stratified(
  data,
  cols = c("fruits", "picker"),
  sort_by = c("frequency", "alphabetical"),
  desc = c(TRUE, FALSE)
)

data[order(strat_ranks), ]
```


#### Tidyverse Integration

An equivalent way to hierarchically sort data.frames is to use the tidyverse `arrange()` function
 
```{r}
library(dplyr)

arrange(
  data,
  rank_stratified(
    data,
    cols = c("fruits", "picker"),
    sort_by = c("frequency", "alphabetical"),
    desc = c(TRUE, FALSE)
  )
)
```
